# What to Do Immediately After Winter Storm Roof Damage in Charlotte & Lake Norman

**The storm has passed, but your work isn't done. If your Charlotte or Lake Norman home sustained roof damage from this weekend's winter storm, here's your complete guide to protecting your home, documenting damage, and getting repairs done right.**

After major winter weather events in the Charlotte metro area, Best Roofing Now typically receives hundreds of emergency calls. This guide will help you navigate the critical first 24-72 hours after storm damage occurs.

## First 24 Hours: Safety and Documentation

### Step 1: Ensure Your Family's Safety (Immediate)

Before assessing any damage, make sure everyone is safe:

**Evacuation triggers—leave immediately if you notice:**
- Ceiling sagging or bulging
- Crackling or creaking sounds from the roof structure
- Large holes or daylight visible through the roof
- Standing water on interior ceilings
- Strong smell of natural gas (call 911)

**If you must stay in the home:**
- Avoid rooms directly under damaged roof sections
- Turn off electricity to affected areas if water is present
- Place buckets under active leaks
- Keep family members and pets away from damage areas

### Step 2: Document Everything (Critical for Insurance)

Your insurance claim success depends heavily on documentation. Do this before any cleanup or repairs:

**Photo and video checklist:**

**Exterior:**
- Wide shots of your entire roof from all four sides
- Close-ups of all visible damage (missing shingles, ice damage, holes)
- Fallen tree limbs or debris on or near your roof
- Damaged gutters, fascia, and soffits
- Any structural issues visible from ground level

**Interior:**
- Water stains on ceilings and walls
- Active leaks (video is especially helpful here)
- Damaged insulation visible in attic
- Any personal property damaged by leaks
- The source of leaks if safely accessible

**Pro tip:** Use your phone's timestamp feature and take photos with location services enabled. This proves when and where damage occurred.

### Step 3: Prevent Further Damage (Within 24 Hours)

You have a legal obligation to **mitigate further damage** to your property. Insurance companies can deny claims if you didn't take reasonable steps to protect your home.

**Safe mitigation steps you can take:**
- Place tarps over exposed areas (if safely accessible from inside attic)
- Move furniture and valuables away from leaks
- Set up buckets and towels to collect water
- Turn off HVAC to prevent spreading water through ductwork

**What requires professional help:**
- Any work on the roof exterior
- Structural repairs
- Removing fallen trees
- Large-scale tarping

**Best Roofing Now provides emergency tarping services 24/7. Call (704) 605-6047 for immediate response in Charlotte and Lake Norman.**

## Filing Your Insurance Claim: Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 4: Contact Your Insurance Company (Within 24-48 Hours)

Most insurance policies require **prompt notification** of damage. Here's how to file effectively:

**Information to have ready:**
- Policy number
- Date and time damage occurred
- Brief description of damage
- Your contact information
- Photos/videos you've collected

**What to say:**
> "I'm reporting roof damage from the winter storm that occurred on [date]. I have photos and videos documenting the damage. I'd like to file a claim and schedule an adjuster inspection."

**Important:** Don't sign anything or accept a settlement until you've had a professional roofing contractor assess the full extent of damage. Initial insurance estimates are often lower than actual repair costs.

### Step 5: Get a Professional Roof Inspection

**Before the adjuster arrives**, have a qualified roofing contractor inspect your roof. This ensures:

- All damage is identified (adjusters often miss hidden damage)
- You have an independent assessment for comparison
- You understand the full scope of repairs needed
- You're not pressured into accepting a low settlement

**Best Roofing Now's Storm Damage Inspection includes:**
- Comprehensive exterior roof inspection
- Drone photography for hard-to-see areas
- Interior inspection for leak sources
- Detailed written report with photos
- Repair cost estimate
- Insurance claim assistance

**Schedule your free storm damage inspection:** Call **(704) 605-6047** or [request online](/contact).

### Step 6: Meet with the Insurance Adjuster

When the adjuster arrives:

**Do:**
- Have your roofing contractor present if possible
- Show them all damage areas (interior and exterior)
- Provide copies of your documentation
- Point out any damage they may have missed
- Ask questions and take notes

**Don't:**
- Sign any documents you don't fully understand
- Accept a verbal estimate—get everything in writing
- Agree to repairs before reviewing the full settlement
- Let them pressure you into a quick decision

## Common Winter Storm Roof Damage in Charlotte & Lake Norman

### Ice Dam Damage

**What it looks like:**
- Water stains on interior ceilings near exterior walls
- Icicles hanging from roof edges
- Ice buildup in gutters
- Wet insulation in attic

**Repair approach:**
- Remove ice dams safely (professional required)
- Repair damaged shingles and underlayment
- Address insulation and ventilation issues to prevent recurrence
- Replace damaged interior drywall

### Fallen Tree/Branch Damage

**What it looks like:**
- Obvious punctures or holes in roof
- Structural damage to trusses or decking
- Damaged gutters and fascia
- Shingle displacement around impact area

**Repair approach:**
- Safe removal of debris (arborist + roofer coordination)
- Structural assessment and repair
- Complete roof section replacement if needed
- Flashing and sealant restoration

### Wind Damage

**What it looks like:**
- Missing or lifted shingles
- Exposed underlayment or decking

**Repair approach:**

### Ice/Freeze Damage to Shingles

**What it looks like:**

**Repair approach:**
- Replace damaged shingles
- Assess extent of freeze damage across roof
- May require full replacement if damage is widespread

## Lake Norman Specific: Waterfront Home Storm Damage

Lake Norman properties often sustain more severe winter storm damage due to:

**Wind exposure:** The open water creates stronger wind gusts that can reach 50+ MPH. Huntersville, Cornelius, Davidson, and Mooresville waterfront homes are particularly vulnerable.

**What to check on lakefront properties:**
- Wind-driven rain damage on lake-facing roof slopes
- Damaged or missing ridge vents
- Compromised chimney flashing
- Lifted or missing shingles on windward sides

**Our Lake Norman storm response team** understands the unique challenges of waterfront properties. We're members of the Lake Norman Chamber of Commerce and have repaired hundreds of lakefront roofs.

## Beware of Storm Chasers

After major storms, Charlotte and Lake Norman see an influx of out-of-town "storm chaser" contractors. Protect yourself:

**Red flags:**
- Door-to-door solicitation immediately after storm
- Pressure to sign contracts quickly
- Requests for large upfront payments
- No local address or references
- "Limited time" deals
- Offering to pay your deductible (this is insurance fraud)

**How to verify a contractor:**
- Check NC State License Board: [nclbgc.org](https://www.nclbgc.org)
- Verify BBB rating: Best Roofing Now is BBB A+ accredited
- Read Google reviews: We have 5 stars with 100+ reviews
- Confirm local address: We're based at 10130 Mallard Creek Rd, Charlotte
- Ask for proof of insurance

## Frequently Asked Questions: After Winter Storm Roof Damage

### How quickly do I need to report roof damage to my insurance company?
Most insurance policies require prompt notification, typically within 24-72 hours of discovering damage. However, you generally have up to one year to file a claim in North Carolina. Still, reporting immediately strengthens your claim and gets the repair process started faster.

### Will my insurance cover all the damage from the winter storm?
Most standard homeowner's policies in North Carolina cover ice, wind, and fallen tree damage to roofs. However, your policy may have deductibles, coverage limits, or exclusions. Review your policy and have Best Roofing Now help you understand what's covered during our free inspection.

### Should I get repair estimates before or after the insurance adjuster visits?
Before, if possible. Having an independent professional assessment ensures you know the full scope of damage and can identify anything the adjuster might miss. Best Roofing Now provides detailed estimates that help you negotiate a fair settlement.

### How long will temporary repairs like tarping last?
Quality emergency tarping can protect your home for several weeks to a few months, depending on weather conditions. However, permanent repairs should be completed as soon as possible to prevent further damage and meet insurance requirements.

### Can Best Roofing Now help with my insurance claim?
Yes. We work with insurance companies daily and understand the claims process. We'll meet with your adjuster, provide documentation, and help ensure you receive a fair settlement. This service is included at no extra charge with our storm damage repairs.

### What if my insurance company's estimate is lower than the repair cost?
This is common. Best Roofing Now can help you supplement your claim with additional documentation of damage. We'll work with your adjuster to ensure all damage is accounted for. If needed, we can recommend public adjusters for complex claims.
