### NEW SECTION: Roof Cricket vs. Roof Diverter - What's the Difference?

You might hear these terms used interchangeably, but there's a difference:

**Roof Cricket (Saddle):**
- A peaked structure that creates a ridge behind the chimney
- Sheds water to both sides
- Required by code for chimneys wider than 30 inches
- Permanent solution built into the roof structure

**Roof Diverter:**
- A simpler metal deflector installed on the roof surface
- Redirects water to one side
- Easier to install but less effective
- Often used as a temporary fix

**My recommendation:** If your chimney is wider than 24 inches, install a proper cricket. The cost difference is minimal when done during roof replacement, and it's far more effective at preventing leaks.

### NEW SECTION: Charlotte's Climate Makes Crickets Essential

Here in Charlotte, we get about 43 inches of rain per year. That's a lot of water hitting your roof. Without a cricket, here's what happens behind a wide chimney:

1. Water flows down the roof toward the chimney
2. It hits the back of the chimney and pools
3. Debris accumulates in that pool (leaves, twigs, granules)
4. The standing water and debris create a dam
5. Water backs up under shingles and into your home

I've seen this pattern hundreds of times in Charlotte homes built in the 80s and 90s when crickets weren't always installed. The damage behind the chimney is often worse than anywhere else on the roof.

**After Charlotte's heavy spring rains**, the first place I check on any roof inspection is behind the chimney. If there's no cricket and the chimney is wide, I'm usually finding problems.

### NEW SECTION: How Much Does a Roof Cricket Cost in 2026?

Here's the honest breakdown:

**During a roof replacement:**
- Materials: $75 - $150
- Labor: $75 - $200
- **Total: $150 - $350**

This is the best time to add a cricket. We're already up there, already have the materials, and can integrate it seamlessly.

**As a standalone project:**
- Materials: $75 - $150
- Labor: $300 - $600 (more setup time)
- **Total: $400 - $750**

**Compare that to water damage repair:**
- Ceiling repair: $500 - $2,000
- Mold remediation: $1,000 - $5,000
- Structural repair: $2,000 - $10,000+

A $300 cricket can prevent $10,000 in damage. That's the definition of a good investment.

### NEW SECTION: Building Code Requirements (2026 Update)

The International Building Code (IBC) and International Residential Code (IRC) require a cricket for any chimney wider than 30 inches. North Carolina follows these codes.

**What the code says (Section R903.2.2):**
> "A cricket or saddle shall be installed on the ridge side of any chimney more than 30 inches wide as measured perpendicular to the slope."

**What this means for you:**
- If your chimney is 30"+ wide and has no cricket, your roof may not be code-compliant
- This can come up during home inspections when selling
- Insurance claims may be affected if water damage occurs behind a non-compliant chimney

**Pro tip:** Even for chimneys under 30 inches, we often recommend crickets if the roof pitch is low (under 6/12) or if the chimney is positioned in a way that catches heavy water flow.

### NEW SECTION: Signs Your Cricket Needs Attention

If you already have a cricket, here's what to watch for:

1. **Flashing separation** - The metal flashing around the cricket should be sealed tight. Gaps mean leaks.

2. **Shingle damage** - The shingles on the cricket take extra abuse. Check for wear.

3. **Debris buildup** - Even with a cricket, debris can accumulate in the valleys. Clean twice yearly.

4. **Rust on metal crickets** - If your cricket is metal (common on flat or low-slope roofs), check for corrosion.

5. **Moss or algae growth** - Indicates moisture retention. Time for cleaning and inspection.

### NEW SECTION: Cricket Maintenance Checklist

Twice a year (spring and fall), check these items:

- [ ] Clear debris from cricket valleys
- [ ] Inspect flashing for gaps or corrosion
- [ ] Check shingles on cricket for damage
- [ ] Look for granule accumulation (sign of shingle wear)
- [ ] Inspect caulk/sealant around chimney
- [ ] Verify water is flowing properly around both sides
- [ ] Check gutters below chimney for proper drainage

**After severe storms:**
- [ ] Look for impact damage from hail
- [ ] Check for debris lodged between cricket and chimney
- [ ] Verify flashing wasn't lifted by wind

### UPDATED FAQ SECTION

**Q: Can I add a cricket to an existing roof?**
A: Yes, though it's easier and cheaper during a full roof replacement. Adding one to an existing roof typically costs $400-$750.

**Q: What materials are crickets made from?**
A: Usually the same materials as your roof - plywood frame covered with shingles or metal flashing on flat roofs.

**Q: How do I know if my chimney needs a cricket?**
A: Measure the width of your chimney where it meets the roof. Over 30 inches = you need one. Under 30 inches = still recommended for most Charlotte homes due to our rainfall.

**Q: Will a cricket change how my roof looks?**
A: Barely. A properly installed cricket blends with the roofline. Most people don't notice them unless they're looking for them.

**Q: How long do roof crickets last?**
A: As long as your roof. When we replace a roof with a cricket, the new cricket is built to match the new roof's lifespan (25-50 years depending on materials).
