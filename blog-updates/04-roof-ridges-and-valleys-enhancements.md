### NEW SECTION: Open Valley vs. Closed Valley - Which Is Better?

One of the most common questions I get is about valley types. Here's the breakdown:

**Open Valley (Metal Lined):**
- Metal flashing visible in the valley
- Shingles stop a few inches from the center
- Water runs directly on metal to gutters

**Pros:**
- Excellent water flow (our recommendation for Charlotte)
- Easy to inspect and maintain
- Less debris accumulation
- Simple to repair if damaged

**Cons:**
- Metal visible (some don't like the look)
- Slightly more expensive initially

**Closed Valley (Woven or Cut):**
- Shingles cover the entire valley
- No metal visible from the ground
- Shingles from each slope overlap

**Pros:**
- Cleaner appearance
- No exposed metal

**Cons:**
- Higher leak risk over time
- Harder to inspect for damage
- Debris can accumulate under shingles
- More difficult to repair

**My recommendation for Charlotte:** I install open metal valleys on almost every roof. Our heavy rainfall (43+ inches per year) needs to move fast. Closed valleys look nice but cause problems in our climate. If your current roof has closed valleys and you're having leak issues, consider switching to open valleys during replacement.

### NEW SECTION: The #1 Repair Call We Get - Valley Leaks

I'd estimate 30-40% of our repair calls involve valleys. Here's why they fail:

**Problem 1: Debris Dams**
Leaves, twigs, and granules accumulate in valleys. During heavy rain, water backs up behind the debris and flows under shingles.

**Solution:** Clean valleys twice yearly. After storms. Any time you see accumulation.

**Problem 2: Worn Valley Flashing**
Metal valleys corrode over time, especially in Charlotte's humidity. Galvanized steel rusts. Even aluminum can corrode at seams.

**Solution:** During inspections, we check valley metal carefully. If it's thinning or has holes, repair before you have interior damage.

**Problem 3: Ice Dams**
Yes, even in Charlotte. After our 2026 winter storms, we saw ice dams in valleys throughout Lake Norman. Water melts during the day, flows to the valley, and refreezes overnight at the eaves. Eventually, water backs up under shingles.

**Solution:** Proper ice and water shield in valleys (at least 2 feet up each slope) and adequate attic insulation/ventilation.

**Problem 4: Poor Installation**
Unfortunately, not all roofers install valleys correctly. Shingles not sealed properly. Flashing too narrow. Incorrect overlap.

**Solution:** Hire a contractor who specifically shows you how they handle valleys. Ask to see examples of their valley work.

### NEW SECTION: Ridge Vent Problems and Solutions

The ridge is the highest point of your roof, and it's critical for ventilation. Here's what can go wrong:

**Problem: Ridge Vent Blowoff**
High winds can lift poorly installed ridge vents. After Charlotte windstorms, we find ridge vents in yards across the neighborhood.

**Solution:** Proper nailing pattern (following manufacturer specs), and ring-shank nails that don't pull out.

**Problem: Rain Infiltration**
Cheap ridge vents or improper installation can let rain enter your attic.

**Solution:** We use baffled ridge vents that allow air flow while blocking wind-driven rain. Worth the small extra cost.

**Problem: Inadequate Ventilation**
Ridge vents only work with proper intake vents (usually soffit vents). Without both, you're just cutting a hole in your roof.

**Solution:** Verify soffit vents are clear and functional. The system needs balance - intake at the bottom, exhaust at the ridge.

### NEW SECTION: Maintaining Ridges and Valleys - Annual Checklist

**Spring (after pollen season):**
- [ ] Clear debris from all valleys
- [ ] Check ridge cap shingles for lifting or damage
- [ ] Inspect valley flashing for rust or corrosion
- [ ] Verify ridge vent is secure and undamaged
- [ ] Clean any moss or algae growth

**Fall (after leaves drop):**
- [ ] Clear leaves from valleys (critical!)
- [ ] Check for granule accumulation
- [ ] Inspect all flashing seals
- [ ] Look for lifted shingles along ridges
- [ ] Verify gutters below valleys are flowing

**After Major Storms:**
- [ ] Visual inspection for obvious damage
- [ ] Check valleys for debris dams
- [ ] Look for impact damage (hail)
- [ ] Verify ridge cap is intact

### NEW SECTION: When Valleys Need Replacement vs. Repair

**Repair makes sense when:**
- Localized damage in one valley
- Flashing is still solid but sealant has failed
- A few shingles need replacement along the valley
- Debris dam caused a one-time leak

**Replacement makes sense when:**
- Valley metal is rusted through or thinning
- Multiple leaks along the same valley
- Shingles are curling or failing in the valley area
- Roof is approaching end of life (20+ years)
- You're experiencing repeated problems after repairs

**Cost comparison in Charlotte (2026):**
- Valley repair: $300 - $800
- Valley re-flashing: $500 - $1,200
- Full roof replacement: $10,000 - $20,000+

Sometimes spending $1,000 on valley repairs buys you 5+ more years from an aging roof. Other times, repeated repairs are just postponing the inevitable. We'll give you an honest assessment.

### NEW SECTION: Valley Protection During Roof Replacement

When we replace a roof in Charlotte, here's how we protect valleys:

1. **Ice and water shield** - Self-adhering membrane extends at least 24 inches up each slope from the valley center. This is your last line of defense against water intrusion.

2. **Quality metal flashing** - We use 26-gauge aluminum or painted steel. Never galvanized that will rust in Charlotte's climate.

3. **Proper shingle overlap** - Shingles extend past the valley center correctly, with no exposed nails near the valley.

4. **Sealed nail heads** - Any nails near the valley get sealed. This seems basic, but it's often skipped.

5. **Wide metal coverage** - We use 24-inch wide valley metal minimum. Some contractors use 18-inch to save money. Don't let them.

### UPDATED FAQ Section

**Q: How often should I clean my roof valleys?**
A: At minimum twice yearly (spring and fall). More often if you have overhanging trees.

**Q: Can I walk on my roof to clean valleys?**
A: We don't recommend it. Shingles are slippery, and walking damages granules. Use a leaf blower from a ladder, or call a professional.

**Q: Why is my valley leaking if there are no missing shingles?**
A: Valley leaks often occur under intact shingles. Debris dams, failed sealant, or corroded flashing can let water in with no visible damage.

**Q: Should I switch from closed to open valleys?**
A: In Charlotte's climate, yes - during your next replacement. Open valleys handle our rainfall better and are easier to maintain.

**Q: How much does valley repair cost in Charlotte?**
A: Typically $300-$800 for a repair, $500-$1,200 for complete re-flashing of one valley.
