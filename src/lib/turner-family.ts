    onQuality:
      "My daddy always said, 'If you're gonna do something, do it right the first time.' That's why we never cut corners on materials or workmanship.",
    onCommunity:
      "Charlotte took me in 15 years ago and gave me a home. Now I get to give back by protecting the homes of my neighbors.",
    onStorms:
      "When storms hit, some companies see dollar signs. I see my neighbors in trouble. That's the difference.",
    onHonesty:
      "I'd rather lose a job being honest than win one being shady. That's not how the Turners do business.",

    onWorkEthic:
      "Back in Alabama, we didn't have fancy tools - just hard work and determination. That mindset hasn't changed.",
    onDetails:
      "The devil's in the details. A roof might look fine from the ground, but we check every shingle, every nail, every flashing.",
    onTeam:
      "Every person on our crew knows: if you wouldn't put it on your own house, don't put it on someone else's.",

    onCustomerCare:
      "When someone calls worried about their roof, they're not just a customer - they're someone's mama or daddy or grandbaby. We treat them that way.",
    onCommunication:
      "Nobody should feel confused about what's happening with their roof. We explain everything in plain English, not contractor-speak.",
    onTrust:
      "Trust is earned one roof at a time. That's why we've never had a single BBB complaint.",
