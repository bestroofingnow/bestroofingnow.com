## CATEGORY 1: ROOFER REACTS / ROOFING FAILS

### Short #1: Storm Chaser Exposé
**Title:** "Storm chaser tried to scam my neighbor for $18,000"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** "A storm chaser just quoted my neighbor $18,000 for this roof..."

**Script (60 sec):**
```
[Show damaged roof photo]
"A storm chaser just quoted my neighbor $18,000 for this roof. Let me show you what's actually wrong.

[Point to damage]
See this? That's ONE damaged shingle. ONE. They told her she needs a full replacement.

[Show their quote]
Look at this quote—'complete tear-off, new decking, premium materials.' For ONE shingle.

[Show repair]
I fixed it in 20 minutes. Cost her $150.

Storm chasers prey on people after every storm in Charlotte. They knock on your door, create fake urgency, and disappear after cashing your insurance check.

Red flags: Door-to-door after storms. 'Limited time' pricing. Pressure to sign today. Out-of-state license plates.

[Hold up business card]
Get a second opinion. Always."

### Short #2: Worst DIY Roof Repair
**Title:** "Homeowner tried to fix their own roof... 😬"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** "POV: You're a roofer and you see this..."

**Script (45 sec):**
```
[Show flex seal disaster]
"So this homeowner watched too many commercials and decided Flex Seal would fix their leak.

[Pan across roof]
They used FOURTEEN CANS. Fourteen.

[Show water damage inside]
And it still leaked. Because Flex Seal isn't roof repair—it's a temporary bandage at best.

[Show the actual problem]
The real issue? A $50 cracked pipe boot. That's it. Would've taken me 15 minutes.

Instead, now we have to remove all this mess, repair the damage it caused, and THEN fix the actual problem.

DIY roof repair costs more than hiring a pro. Every. Single. Time."

### Short #3: Layers of Lies
**Title:** "Found 4 LAYERS of shingles on this roof 🤯"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** "You're not gonna believe what's under here..."

**Script (50 sec):**
```
[Peeling back shingle layer]
"So we started tearing off what we thought was a normal roof...

[Reveal second layer]
Layer one... okay, sometimes people roof over.

[Reveal third layer]
Layer TWO?! Alright, that's illegal in most places.

[Reveal fourth layer]
LAYER THREE?! This house has been roofed over FOUR TIMES.

[Show rotted decking]
And look at the decking underneath. It's like wet cardboard. This has been leaking for YEARS and every 'roofer' just slapped another layer on top.

[Show weight concern]
Four layers of shingles weighs about 1,000 pounds per 100 square feet. This roof was about to collapse.

The previous owners had no idea. The inspector missed it. Four different contractors committed fraud.

This is why you hire licensed, insured professionals who actually tear off and inspect."

### Short #4: Insurance Adjuster Lowball
**Title:** "Insurance offered $4,200. We got them $19,000."

**Hook (0-3 sec):** "The insurance company tried to pay $4,200 for this..."

**Script (55 sec):**
```
[Show storm damage]
"Hurricane came through Charlotte. This roof got hammered. Obvious damage everywhere.

[Show initial estimate]
Insurance adjuster comes out, offers $4,200. Says 'minor repairs needed.'

[Walk the roof pointing out damage]
Minor? Look at this. Missing shingles here. Cracked shingles here. Damaged flashing. Broken ridge cap. Water already in the attic.

[Show our documentation]
We did a full inspection with drone footage, 47 photos, and a detailed scope of work.

[Show supplement]
Filed a supplement. Met with the adjuster again. Showed them what they missed.

[Show final check]
Final settlement: $19,400. Full roof replacement covered.

[Face camera]
Insurance adjusters work for the insurance company—not for you. Always get a contractor inspection before accepting their first offer."

### Short #5: "Professional" Install Fail
**Title:** "They charged $12,000 for THIS 💀"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** "A 'professional' roofer charged $12,000 for this installation..."

**Script (45 sec):**
```
[Show crooked shingles]
"Look at these lines. A kindergartner with a crayon draws straighter than this.

[Show exposed nails]
Exposed nails everywhere. Every one of these is a future leak.

[Show improper flashing]
They caulked the chimney flashing instead of stepping it properly. That caulk lasts maybe 2 years.

[Show starter strip issue]
No starter strip. The first wind storm, these are gone.

[Show the 'best' part]
But the best part? They left the old drip edge on and just... roofed over it.

This homeowner paid $12,000. Cash. No warranty paperwork. No permit pulled.

And now they're paying us to do it right.

Always verify licenses. Always get permits. Always get it in writing."

**Title:** "This roof was 30 years old... 😱➡️😍"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** [Split screen - ugly roof / beautiful roof]

**Script (40 sec):**
```
[Show old roof - moss, missing shingles, sagging]
"30 years. No maintenance. This roof was barely holding on.

[Timelapse tear-off]
Day one: Complete tear-off. Found rotted decking in three spots.

[Show decking repair]
Replaced 12 sheets of OSB. This is why tear-offs matter.

[Timelapse new install]
Day two: New ice and water shield, synthetic underlayment, and CertainTeed Landmark shingles in Weathered Wood.

[Final glamour shot]
Day three: New ridge vent, pipe boots, and flashing.

From disaster to decade-ready in 72 hours.

[Homeowner reaction if available]
The homeowner couldn't believe it was the same house."

### Short #7: Gutter Cleaning Satisfaction
**Title:** "This is what 5 years of neglect looks like..."

**Hook (0-3 sec):** [Show completely clogged gutter]

**Script (35 sec):**
```
[Show packed gutter]
"Five years. Zero cleanings. Charlotte's tree canopy did THIS.

[Start scooping]
This isn't leaves anymore. This is compost. There's a whole ecosystem in here.

[Show the flow return]
And... [water starts flowing] ...there it goes.

[Pan to downspout]
The downspout was completely blocked. Watch this.

[Clear downspout - satisfying water rush]
That sound? That's your foundation NOT getting destroyed.

Clean your gutters twice a year. Or this happens."

### Short #8: Moss Removal Transformation
**Title:** "This roof was being eaten alive 🌿"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** [Show moss-covered roof]

**Script (40 sec):**
```
[Show mossy roof]
"Charlotte humidity + north-facing roof + shade = this.

Moss isn't just ugly—it's destroying these shingles. It holds moisture against the roof and lifts shingles at the edges.

[Show treatment application]
We apply a zinc-based treatment that kills the moss without pressure washing. Pressure washing destroys shingles.

[Timelapse or before/after]
Two weeks later...

[Show clean roof]
The moss dies, rain washes it away, and the shingles can actually do their job again.

[Show zinc strip installation]
We install zinc strips at the ridge. Every time it rains, zinc particles wash down and prevent regrowth.

This roof just got 5+ more years of life for a fraction of replacement cost."

## CATEGORY 3: SECRETS & HOT TAKES

### Short #9: Things Roofers Won't Tell You
**Title:** "3 things roofers don't want you to know"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** "Things most roofers hope you never find out..."

**Script (55 sec):**
```
[Face camera, conspiratorial tone]
"I'm about to get hate from other roofers for this, but here we go.

NUMBER ONE: That 'lifetime warranty' on your shingles? It's prorated after 10 years. Year 25, it might cover 20% of materials only. Labor? Zero.

NUMBER TWO: Most roofing estimates are padded 20-30%. They quote high expecting you to negotiate. Don't be afraid to ask questions and get multiple quotes.

NUMBER THREE: You probably don't need a new roof. I turn away half my inspections because a repair will work fine. Most companies don't make money on repairs, so they push replacements.

BONUS: Roof-overs—putting new shingles over old—are legal in NC up to two layers. But they void most manufacturer warranties and hide problems. Always ask for tear-off.

Now you know."

### Short #10: Hot Take - Cheapest Quote
**Title:** "Why I tell people NOT to hire me"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** "Sometimes I tell homeowners not to hire us..."

**Script (50 sec):**
```
"Sometimes I walk away from jobs. Here's why.

When someone says 'I got a quote for $6,000—can you beat it?' I say no. And I tell them not to hire that company either.

Here's the math: Materials for a typical Charlotte roof cost $4,000-5,000. Labor, insurance, permits, dumpster, overhead... A legitimate company CANNOT install a quality roof for $6,000.

So what are they cutting?
- Skipping the permit
- Using seconds or off-brand materials
- No workers comp insurance
- Hiring day laborers with no training
- Not tearing off properly

That $6,000 roof costs $15,000 when you have to redo it in 5 years.

I'd rather lose a job than watch a homeowner get scammed. Call me crazy."

### Short #11: What Your Inspector Missed
**Title:** "Your home inspector probably missed this..."

**Hook (0-3 sec):** "Did your home inspector actually go ON the roof?"

**Script (45 sec):**
```
"Real talk: Most home inspectors look at your roof from the ground with binoculars. Some don't even do that.

[Show roof issue]
They can't see this from the driveway. Cracked flashing around the chimney.

[Show another issue]
Or this—nail pops hidden under lifted shingles.

[Show another]
Or this—damaged pipe boots that are one rainstorm away from leaking.

[Face camera]
A general home inspection is NOT a roof inspection. Inspectors have 3 hours to check everything—HVAC, electrical, plumbing, structure, AND the roof.

If you're buying a house, get a dedicated roof inspection from an actual roofing contractor. It's usually free, and it could save you $15,000.

I've seen people close on houses and need new roofs within 6 months. Don't be that person."

**Title:** "Charlotte after last night's storm 🌪️"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** [Dramatic storm damage footage]

**Script (45 sec):**
```
[Show damage - tree on roof, missing shingles, etc.]
"This is what we woke up to in Charlotte this morning.

[Walking through damage]
Tree through the roof here. Entire sections of shingles gone here. Power lines down everywhere.

[Show emergency tarping]
Our crew's been out since 5am doing emergency tarps. This family's living room was getting rained on.

[Show the work]
Blue tarp goes up, water stops coming in. That buys time until we can properly assess and repair.

[Face camera]
If your roof got hit:
1. Document everything with photos
2. Don't go on the roof yourself
3. Call your insurance
4. Call us

### Short #13: Hail Damage Truth
**Title:** "Is this actually hail damage? Let me show you"

**Hook (0-3 sec):** "Storm chasers say EVERYTHING is hail damage..."

**Script (50 sec):**
```
[On roof]
"Just had a hail storm in Charlotte. Everyone's got roofers knocking on their door claiming damage. Let me show you what REAL hail damage looks like versus what's not.

[Show real hail damage]
THIS is hail damage. See these circular dents? Random pattern? Soft spots when you press? Granule displacement in a splatter pattern? That's hail.

[Show what's NOT hail damage]
THIS is not hail damage. This is blistering—happens from heat and poor ventilation. See how it's uniform, follows patterns?

[Show another example]
And THIS is foot traffic damage. Someone walked here. Hail doesn't leave boot prints.

[Face camera]
Storm chasers will call everything hail damage because they get paid either way. Your insurance rates go up for false claims.

Get an honest assessment before you file."

[4:45am alarm]
"4:45. Let's go.

[Getting ready, loading truck]
5:30 - Loading the truck while it's still dark. Charlotte summer means we start early or we die.

[Arriving at job site at dawn]
6:15 - On site. Coffee and crew meeting. Today's job: full tear-off and replacement in Huntersville.

[Timelapse tear-off]
6:30 to 10am - Tear-off. This is the hard part. 95 degrees by 9am on a black roof.

[Lunch break]
11:00 - Lunch in the shade. Hydrate or die isn't a joke up here.

[Afternoon install]
12 to 5pm - Installation. This is the satisfying part. Watching a new roof come together.

[Final clean up]
5:30 - Magnetic sweep, clean the yard, final walkthrough with the homeowner.

[Exhausted in truck]
6:00 - Done. Home by 7. Do it again tomorrow.

**Script (55 sec):**
```
[Somber tone]
"Got a call last month. Elderly woman, lives alone in Cornelius. Her roof was leaking into her bedroom. She'd already paid another company $8,000 for 'repairs.' They ghosted her.

[Show the 'repair']
This is what they did. They put roofing cement over a hole and called it done. $8,000.

[Show the actual damage]
The leak was still there. Mold growing in the attic. Ceiling about to collapse.

[Show our work]
We came out same day. Found the real problem—failed valley flashing. Fixed it properly.

[Show completed repair]
Total cost? $1,200.

[Show her thank you card/message]
She sent us this.

This is why we do this. Not every roofer is a scammer, but enough are that good people get hurt.

## CATEGORY 6: QUICK TIPS (High Volume)

### Short #16: 30-Second Attic Check
**Title:** "Check your attic RIGHT NOW (30 seconds)"

**Script (30 sec):**
```
"Go to your attic. Right now. I'll wait.

Look for:
- Daylight coming through (bad)
- Water stains on wood (bad)
- Black mold spots (really bad)
- Sagging between rafters (call someone today)

If you see any of these, you have a roof problem. Maybe small, maybe big, but it exists.

Free inspections—link in bio."
```

---

### Short #17: Gutter Check
**Title:** "Your gutters are telling you something"

**Script (30 sec):**
```
"Look in your gutters. What do you see?

Leaves and twigs? Clean them.

Black sandy stuff? Those are granules from your shingles. Some is normal. A lot means your roof is aging.

Standing water? Your gutters aren't sloped right. That's rotting your fascia.

Nothing because you never look? That's how houses get damaged.

Takes 60 seconds. Do it today."
```

---

### Short #18: The $20 Test
**Title:** "This $20 test could save you $15,000"

**Script (35 sec):**
```
"Buy a moisture meter. $20 at any hardware store.

Go to your attic. Touch it to the wood around vents, chimneys, and valleys.

Green light? You're good.
Yellow light? Watch that area.
Red light? You have water getting in somewhere.

Catching leaks early = repairs.
Catching leaks late = replacement.

$20 now or $15,000 later. Your choice."
```

---

### Short #19: The Binocular Trick
**Title:** "How to inspect your roof without climbing"

**Script (35 sec):**
```
"Never climb on your roof. Here's what to do instead.

Grab binoculars. Seriously.

From the ground, look for:
- Missing or crooked shingles
- Rust on flashing
- Clogged gutters
- Anything that looks 'off'

Walk all four sides of your house.

See something concerning? THEN call a professional.

Don't be the person who fell off their roof checking for damage. That's our job."
```

## CATEGORY 7: TRENDJACKING & SEASONAL

### Short #20: Winter Storm Alert
**Title:** "Charlotte winter storm coming - protect your roof NOW"

**Script (45 sec):**
```
"Winter storm hitting Charlotte this weekend. Here's what to do TODAY.

[Checklist on screen]
1. Clean gutters NOW. Ice dams form in clogged gutters and destroy your roof edge.

2. Trim any branches touching your roof. Ice makes them heavy and they WILL break.

3. Check attic insulation. Warm attic = melting snow = ice dams = leaks.

4. Know where your main water shutoff is. If a pipe freezes and bursts, you need to act fast.

5. Save a roofer's number. We offer 24/7 emergency service.

[Face camera]
If you wake up to damage Sunday, don't panic. Document it, don't climb on ice, and call us.

704-605-6047. Stay safe Charlotte."

### Short #21: Spring Inspection Reminder
**Title:** "Spring checklist your roofer wants you to know"

**Script (40 sec):**
```
"Spring in Charlotte. Pollen, rain, and the damage winter left behind.

Your spring roof checklist:

1. Look for winter damage—cracked shingles, lifted edges, damaged flashing.

2. Clean gutters of all that pollen buildup. It clogs faster than you think.

3. Check for moss and algae growth—our humidity makes it worse.

4. Trim back any branches that grew over winter.

5. Schedule your annual inspection. Problems are cheaper to fix before summer storms.

Most roof problems start small. Spring is when you catch them."
```
